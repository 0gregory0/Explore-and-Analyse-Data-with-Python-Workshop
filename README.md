A significant part of a a data scientist's role is to explore, analyze, and visualize data. There are many tools and programming languages that they can use to do this. One of the most popular approaches is to use Jupyter notebooks (like this one) and Python.

Python is a flexible programming language that's used in a wide range of scenarios, from web applications to device programming. It's extremely popular in the data-science and machine-learning communities because of the many packages it supports for data analysis and visualization.

In this notebook, we'll explore some of these packages and apply basic techniques to analyze data. This isn't intended to be a comprehensive Python programming exercise or even a deep dive into data analysis. Rather, it's intended as a crash course in some of the common ways in which data scientists can use Python to work with data.
